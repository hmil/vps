title: Clapruptor
description: |-
  A small device placed on a USB power outlet allows users to turn the lights on and off with a clap of hands.

  The system is extremely power efficient, drawing only a few microamps in continuous operation.

  Sound is captured by a condenser microphone and is processed by an analog circuit. The filtered signal is fed into an interrupt handler on an Attiny microcontroller.

  A custom PCB was designed in EAGLE and manufactured by jlcpcb.  
  The 3d printed enclosure was designed in OnShape.
