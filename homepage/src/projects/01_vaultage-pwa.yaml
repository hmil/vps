description: |-
  A mobile app for the [Vaultage](/projects/vaultage.html) password manager,
  although based on web technologies, can be installed on a mobiled device and works offline
  just like a native app.

  The app was build with Angular 9 and served as a testing ground for the [ng-vacuum](https://code.hmil.fr/ng-vacuum)
  package.
